//  Intro - Welome

//  Pick what kind of Taco and How Many
        
        // Two kinds of Taco
            // one taco takes a little longer than the other taco
        
        // Choose How many Tacos

//  Process - console log all of the ingrdients cooking async

//  After Processing - Ask if they would like to order more tacos



//  Make empty classes for all of the ingredients and seperate them into two folders depending on whcih taco they belong to


//  Master Method that takes in amount and kind(s) of taco
    //  -(int amountOfTypeOne, int amountOfTypeTwo)
    // Run CopyCat of BreakfastAsync Method
            


// Copy BreakfastAsync for the creation of each taco
    // each taco will have a method that runs all of the processing 
        // each method will know how many to make from the master methods args of (amountOfTypeOne, and amountOfTypeTwo)
    // when done a bollean will e flipped from false to true

// Maybe put all of this in a WHILE method that depends on a boolean of whether or not that order is done.
// Once while method is up, run the Intro again and ask if they would like to continue or not
