# My Taco Truck

### This is a simple C# ASP.NET Core Console Application that simulates a storefront/ food truck and lets users place orders and customize their tacos which then get processed asynchronously and are output to the console in an order depending on which taco is completed first. Tacos get completed when all of the ingredients have been processed. Each ingredient takes a specific amount of time to be processed so depending on which taco a user chooses or creates, that will affect the waiting period for each taco.
