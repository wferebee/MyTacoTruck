# My Taco Truck

### This is a simple C# ASP.NET Core Console Application that simulates a storefront/ foodtruck and lets users place orders and customize their tacos which then get processed asynchronously and are output to the console in an order dependig on which taco is completed first. Tacos get completed when all of the ingrdients have been procesed. Each ingredient takes a specific amount of time to be proessed so depending on which taco a user chooses or creates, that will effect the wait period for each taco.
